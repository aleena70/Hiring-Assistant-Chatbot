        "In Python, a list is mutable, meaning its elements can be added, removed, or modified after creation, while a tuple is immutable, meaning its contents cannot be changed once defined. Lists are typically used when you need a dynamic collection that can be updated, such as when storing user inputs or items in a cart. Tuples, on the other hand, are used for fixed collections of data that should remain constant, such as coordinates or configuration settings."
